Love it or hate it, Indian parents are increasingly demanding English-medium education.  In 2005, only 3\% of children in India were attending English-medium schools. Today, 21\% of children are learning in English-medium primary schools. In light of research that recommends mother tongue over English medium, are parents of these 21\% of children making a wrong decision? Not really. This is true despite a very clear research backed evidence that mother tongue is a more effective medium for learning.

One of the most important purposes of education in India today is social mobility. Parents believe that English-medium education is one good way for them to get ahead in society. This is not their own idea but that of the society which rewards English fluency so much that English fluency is considered a very strong signal of smartness in India. Unless we change that mindset, National Education Policy's latest efforts to reform primary education to be in mother tongue medium will backfire. Here is how:
\par
Imagine the year 2026, six years after NEP, when the first batch of all children in India who have finished their primary school in mother tongue medium are transitioning to middle and secondary schooling.
\par
Consider a scenario in which some parents make a choice of English-medium middle and secondary schooling because children need to learn all subjects in English-medium to prepare for premier colleges which all continue to remain English-medium. In a very disruptive way, these children have to keep switching between vocabulary, terminology, and grammar of the English medium and their old mother tongue medium. It is inconvenient and discouraging, to the extent of penalizing them in their transition to secondary schools.
\par
Consider the alternative scenario in which some parents stick with the mother tongue medium until the secondary school and in 2032 their child is able to secure admission in prestigious college. Unfortunately, all of these colleges still continue to teach in English-medium. The complexity of technical terms and vocabulary that these children could have learned at the secondary stage has now more than doubled in college. The students are scrambling to simultaneously translate between two languages in order to write, speak, listen, and read in English. Penalized in this scenario, as well.
\par
There are a large number of students who enroll in second or third-tier colleges which are in their mother tongue medium. Let's assume for a moment that this student maintains a superior conceptual understanding throughout college because of learning in the mother tongue. However, when this student enters the job market, s(he) finds it to be biased - English fluency is a signal of smartness. Biased employers based hiring decision on English fluency over superior conceptual understanding and this student doesn't get the job (s)he is otherwise qualified for. When ultimately he or she does, lack of English fluency doesn't let him or her advance in the career as  unfortunately, clients and organizational leadership also value English fluency. The students who didn't develop English fluency in college is penalized in the job market and throughout their careers.
\par
In short, as long as the English fluency remains the signal for smartness, bias towards it will not change and the student who doesn't have it will be repeatedly penalized in different stages of their education and career. And this is true not just for degree courses but even for other vocations such as a driver or a beautician as even those job markets currently put a premium on English fluency. To carry out mother tongue as a medium even in our primary schools successfully, what we need is the overhaul of the society's mindset otherwise we will end up penalizing children and their parents in their hard pursuit of social mobility. That change in  society's mindset is a harder battle than fixing the policy that we have currently left incomplete.
\par
The job of a good education policy on mother tongue should be to find the middle ground between what's ideal and what's pragmatic. As long as society values English, student need to develop English fluency at some stage and policy should  design to make that transition as easy as it can.  If they are learning in mother tongue medium primary schools, they need support in transitioning to English-medium at higher grades.   If children are learning in English-medium primary schools, they need support in understanding concepts in all subjects. The policy will need to support them either way.
\par
What we can and should ensure that children are fluent in both languages, whatever be the medium. This way, they will be prepared to overcome the relative economic and pedagogical disadvantages of either of the two mediums. Without a doubt, our children are blessed with genetic endowment to be fluent in multiple languages. Let's not underestimate them. Let us all just do better.
